# N1 Github

### The Github info viewer for Nylas Mail and Nylas N1/Pro
This is an improved version of the [View on Github](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/N1-GitHub) plugin, extended by [@ForbesLindesay](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay) which shows both whether the e-mail is about an issue, pull request, or something else, and whether the issue or pull request is closed.

The updated version provides cohesion in design when using labels to organize mail and reduces the button size to look more like the default N1 theme.
